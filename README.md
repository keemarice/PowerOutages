## Introduction

In this project, we examine a dataset of major power outages in the U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016 from publicly available datasets from the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. Census Bureau. This data coalesces information on major outage patterns and characteristics of the U.S. states, like climate and topographic characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, population, and land-cover characteristics. Through this information, it is possible to analyze patterns by state, climate type, and electricity demand. 

The raw data set contains # of rows, recording # different power outages and records the folowing information:



In this project, we focus on the following question:

How long do power outages before power is restored? 

These questions could give insight into improvements to infrastructure resilience in different states and electrical grids, and the improvement in technology or restoration time from 2000 to 2016.
